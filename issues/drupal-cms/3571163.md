## Summary

Drupal CMS now includes a dedicated CONTRIBUTING.md file that guides potential contributors through the setup process. People who wanted to contribute were cloning the wrong repository and getting stuck because there was no clear documentation. The new file explains the monorepo structure, provides step-by-step DDEV installation instructions, and links to the development issue queue and Slack channel. The README.md was also updated to point to this new contributor guide.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

The Drupal CMS project template now includes a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the `project_template/` directory. This file addresses a recurring problem where contributors would clone the published Composer package repository instead of the development repository.

The new `CONTRIBUTING.md` explains that Drupal CMS uses a monorepo structure that automatically splits into smaller projects. It specifies DDEV version 1.24.0 or later as a requirement and provides three commands to get started: clone the repository from `git@git.drupal.org:project/drupal_cms.git`, change into the directory, and run `ddev launch`.

The file also documents common DDEV commands like `ddev drush` and `ddev composer`, and directs contributors to open issues and merge requests in the Drupal CMS development issue queue. It includes links to the code of conduct, the `#drupal-cms-development` Slack channel, and DDEV documentation.

The `README.md` was refactored to remove redundant contribution information and now references `CONTRIBUTING.md` instead. The "Contributing" section was renamed to "Contributing & Support" and streamlined to focus on reporting issues and getting support, with a link to the new contributor guide.
