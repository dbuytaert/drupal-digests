## Summary

Drupal CMS now offers a "Blank" template option during installation for users who want to start with a minimal foundation. This template provides Drupal CMS's baseline functionality without the Mercury design system or component library, giving developers complete freedom to build their own design approach. The blank template includes an automatically generated minimal theme with just header, content, and footer regions, plus a single blank Canvas page as the home page.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

The blank template is implemented by making `drupal_cms_site_template_base` visible and usable during installation. Previously, this site template was hidden from the installer UI and only available to developers via command line.

The implementation leverages the `site_template_helper` Composer plugin to dynamically generate a minimal theme called "blank" when the template is installed. This theme is based on core's `starterkit_theme` but includes only three regions: header, content, and footer. The theme generation happens automatically at `composer require` time through plugin configuration in the site template's `composer.json`.

The `drupal_cms_installer_install_tasks_alter()` function was simplified by removing the `SiteTemplateFormAlter` class that previously hid `drupal_cms_site_template_base` from the installer. The template now appears alongside other options like Starter and the various prebuilt templates.

The installer UI received CSS improvements to accommodate the additional template option, switching from a fixed three-column grid to a responsive grid that adapts from two to four columns based on viewport width. The `SiteExporter` service was updated to remove development-only dependencies like `site_template_helper` when exporting site configurations.

The blank template includes a single empty Canvas page set as the front page to avoid a 404 on first visit. It also includes the utility page content type through `drupal_cms_content_type_base`, which provides the Canvas page functionality.

## Collaboration

phenaproxima implemented the technical approach after pameeela identified the need and lauriii provided requirements feedback. phenaproxima resurrected and integrated the `site_template_helper` plugin to enable dynamic theme generation, solving the challenge of scaffolding a minimal theme without maintaining another static theme in the codebase.

## Lessons learned

- When generating scaffolding at dependency installation time, use Composer plugins to run generation scripts. This allows site templates to create themes dynamically from starter kits without maintaining static copies that drift out of sync with upstream. *(via phenaproxima)*
- When designing starter templates, distinguish between customization that users might want versus customization they definitely need. Ship pre-built themes for optional customization, but generate minimal scaffolds for scenarios where users must customize. *(via phenaproxima)*
