## Summary

Drupal CMS 2.0 brings a major documentation refresh to help site builders and content editors find what they need faster. The documentation has been reorganized with a clearer structure, splitting "Create" content into "Get Started," "Customize," and "Manage" sections. Many outdated tutorials have been removed or rewritten, screenshots updated, and navigation paths corrected to reflect the 2.0 interface. The changes make it easier to discover features like recommended add-ons, accessibility tools, email setup, hosting guidance, and content management workflows.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

This issue consolidated documentation updates for the Drupal CMS 2.0 release across multiple merge requests. The changes reorganized the information architecture by moving files between directories: content from `docs/src/create/` was redistributed to `docs/src/get-started/`, `docs/src/customize/`, and in some cases removed entirely. Files moved to `customize/` include add-ons, modules, email setup, hosting, consent management, and privacy policy documentation. New content in `get-started/` covers site settings and theme customization. Several tutorials were deleted, including workflows, site-settings, and detailed navigation guidance, while others were significantly condensed. The contributor removed verbose "Goal," "Prerequisites," "Next steps," and "Wrap-up" sections from most tutorials to streamline the content. Screenshots were updated throughout to reflect the 2.0 administrative interface, and admin paths were corrected (switching from old-style notation to the newer format). The changes also removed references to features not present in 2.0, such as the Events content type, and updated feature descriptions to match current functionality. Binary image files were deleted or replaced as part of the refresh.

## Collaboration

This documentation refresh was a collaborative effort between pameeela and phenaproxima over two weeks with three commits. The approach of merging updates in stages made reviews more manageable. Pameeela created the initial merge request and noted it was "better than what we have" even before completion, allowing incremental improvement. After the first merge, pameeela continued refining and reviewed every documentation page before submitting a second merge request. Phenaproxima handled merging to the 2.x branch and cherry-picking necessary changes back to the 2.0.x release branch. This iterative process demonstrates how large documentation projects can be broken into reviewable chunks while still achieving comprehensive coverage.
