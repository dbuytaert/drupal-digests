## Summary

Documentation for Drupal CMS now includes a dedicated page explaining AI tools and how to use them for content creation and site administration. The AI assistant can generate accessible image descriptions, help navigate configuration options, and assist with building features like content types and taxonomies. The SEO documentation has also been updated to reflect that the HTML Sitemap module was removed from Drupal CMS 2.0, focusing instead on the XML sitemap for search engines.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

This change adds a new documentation file at `docs/src/customize/ai-tools.md` that describes Drupal CMS's AI features including the AI assistant chatbot and automated alternate text generation for images. The documentation covers installation steps for the AI Assistant add-on, configuration for three supported providers (amazee.ai, Anthropic, and OpenAI), and practical examples of using AI tools for navigation, content tasks, and feature scaffolding.

The existing SEO documentation in `docs/src/promote/essentials.md` and `docs/src/promote/install.md` was updated to remove references to the HTML Sitemap module, which is no longer part of Drupal CMS 2.0. The updated docs clarify that Simple XML Sitemap is the tool for search engine indexing, and several broken links were corrected throughout the SEO documentation files.

## Timeline

- Opened: February 15, 2026
- Committed: February 17, 2026 (1 day later)
