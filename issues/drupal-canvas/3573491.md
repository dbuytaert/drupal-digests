## Summary

The `canvas create` command previously failed for users without GitHub SSH keys configured because default project templates used SSH Git URLs. This affected first-time setup and environments where SSH is not available. The default template URLs now use HTTPS instead, which works without special authentication setup. This makes the scaffolding process more accessible for new users and works in more environments out of the box.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

The `templates.json` file in the `packages/create` directory defines the default project templates available to the `canvas create` command. Previously, the template repositories used SSH URLs in the format `git@github.com:owner/repo.git`. This required users to have GitHub SSH keys configured before they could scaffold a new project.

The fix changes the repository URLs to HTTPS format (`https://github.com/owner/repo.git`). This applies to both default templates: `acquia/nebula` and `balintbrews/canvas-starter`. HTTPS URLs work without any authentication configuration for public repositories, making the tool work immediately for first-time users.

This is a configuration change that affects how Git clones the template repositories during project creation. The change does not modify any code behavior or API, just the data source for the scaffolding process.
