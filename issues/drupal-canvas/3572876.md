## Summary

Five JavaScript packages distributed on npm for building Canvas Code Components have changed their license from GPL-2.0-or-later to MIT. This reduces licensing friction for developers who use these packages in their own applications. The packages affected are `drupal-canvas`, `@drupal-canvas/create`, `@drupal-canvas/eslint-config`, `@drupal-canvas/extensions`, and `@drupal-canvas/vite-plugin`. A new licensing guide now helps contributors choose the right license for future Canvas JavaScript packages based on how tightly coupled they are to Drupal runtime APIs.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

The Canvas team relicensed five npm packages from GPL-2.0-or-later to MIT. These packages provide tooling and utilities for authoring Canvas Code Components but do not directly integrate with Drupal or Canvas runtime APIs. Because they have standalone utility and no tight coupling to GPL-licensed code, MIT licensing is more appropriate.

A new `docs/javascript-package-license-guide.md` file documents criteria for choosing between GPL-2.0-or-later and MIT for future packages. The guide uses a checklist approach: packages should stay GPL when they use Drupal runtime APIs like `Drupal.behaviors`, are distributed inside module artifacts, derive from GPL-only code, or only work within Drupal internals. Packages can use MIT when they have clear standalone boundaries, no direct Drupal coupling, permissive dependency trees, and remain useful outside Drupal.

The relicensed packages include the CLI scaffold tool (`@drupal-canvas/create`), base utilities and components (`drupal-canvas`), ESLint configuration (`@drupal-canvas/eslint-config`), extension APIs (`@drupal-canvas/extensions`), and Vite plugin (`@drupal-canvas/vite-plugin`). Each package version was bumped and republished to npm with the MIT license.
