## Summary

Canvas now includes documentation for using the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin with Code Components. This plugin provides pre-styled typography classes that make it easy to render rich text content from Drupal fields with beautiful, consistent formatting. Site builders can now apply professional typography to content blocks without writing custom CSS for every HTML element.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

The Canvas documentation now covers how to use the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin with the `FormattedText` component. This plugin was made available in [#3553356](https://www.drupal.org/project/canvas/issues/3553356) but lacked usage documentation.

The new documentation section explains how to enable the plugin by adding `@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography"` to Global CSS, then applying the `prose` class to `FormattedText` components to style rendered HTML content. It covers the plugin's key features including size modifiers (`prose-sm` through `prose-2xl`), dark mode support with `prose-invert`, element-specific modifiers like `prose-headings:underline`, the `not-prose` escape hatch, and removing the built-in max-width constraint.

The documentation was added to the Code Components packages page at `docs/user/src/content/docs/code-components/packages.mdx` alongside other built-in package documentation.
