# #3565904: When loading an Assistant for the first time, it jumps to the right

- **Project:** Drupal AI
- **Type:** Major bug report

## Summary

A visual bug caused the Drupal CMS Assistant interface element to appear on the right side of the screen instead of its intended left position when first loaded after a cache clear or hard refresh. Refreshing the page again would sometimes correct the position. This issue was resolved as part of upgrading to the latest version of the FlowDrop UI library.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

This was a positioning bug in the Drupal CMS Assistant interface that occurred specifically on initial page load after cache clearing. The assistant component would incorrectly render on the right side of the viewport instead of its intended left-side position. Subsequent page refreshes would sometimes correct the positioning, though behavior varied between local and hosted environments like Drupalforge.

The issue was tracked as part of the FlowDrop UI Agents module and was resolved by migrating to the latest version of the FlowDrop UI library in [#3572310](https://www.drupal.org/project/flowdrop_ui_agents/issues/3572310). The fix addresses the timing or initialization logic that determines the assistant's initial position on the page, ensuring consistent left-side placement on first render.

## Timeline

- Opened: January 6, 2026

## Collaboration

d34dman and gxleano coordinated the resolution by identifying that this positioning bug would be addressed through the broader FlowDrop UI migration effort, connecting this isolated visual issue to the larger library upgrade work.
