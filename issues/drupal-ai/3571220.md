## Summary

The AI module now provides a more flexible and reusable CSS system for styling AI-related interfaces. CSS classes now reference AI-specific variables instead of directly referencing theme variables, making it easier to customize AI components without modifying markup. The update also adds new icon variations for common AI interface elements like settings, status indicators, and external links, giving module developers a consistent visual language across AI features.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

This change introduces a new layer of CSS custom properties prefixed with `--ai-` that wrap Drupal core's CSS variables. Instead of classes like `.ai-font-size-s` directly referencing `var(--font-size-s)`, they now reference `--ai-font-size-s`, which itself falls back to the core variable. This indirection allows developers to override AI-specific styling by targeting the AI variables without needing to modify markup or create custom classes.

The icon system was refactored from modifier classes like `.ai-info-link--provider` to a BEM-style pattern using `.ai-icon-button` as the base component and `.ai-icon--provider` as the modifier. The `.ai-icon` class can be used standalone for inline icons, while `.ai-icon-button` provides a full clickable button treatment with hover, focus, and active states. Icon sizing now uses `--ai-icon-size` and `--ai-icon-size-lg` variables.

Form-specific styles were extracted from `ai_global.css` into a new `ai_settings_form.css` file with its own library (`ai_settings_form`), keeping the global utilities truly reusable. Nine new icon SVGs were added including settings (gear), status indicators (checkmark-circle, x-circle, warning), and UI elements (external, option, arrow-left-up, cloud-arrow-down, file).

The `AiSettingsForm` class was updated to use the new icon class names and attach the new settings form library.

## Collaboration

bbruno identified the limitation while implementing the global classes on the AI dashboard and created the merge request with the proposed solution. erichomanchuk made the icon naming more generic and refactored form-specific styles into their own file, establishing cleaner architectural boundaries. danrod rebased the merge request and verified the visual changes worked correctly across the interface.
