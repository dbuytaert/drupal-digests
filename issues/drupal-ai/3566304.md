# #3566304: The Edit Cog for the Chatbot is hidden behind the chat window.

- **Project:** Drupal AI
- **Type:** Major bug report
- **Version:** 1.0.x-dev
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Discussion:** [#3566304](https://www.drupal.org/node/3566304) · 4 contributors · 13 comments

## Summary

A visual bug in the chatbot interface prevented users from accessing the edit button. The configuration control (edit cog) was positioned behind the chat window, making it impossible to click. This issue has been resolved as part of a broader update to the FlowDrop UI components.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

This was a CSS z-index or positioning issue in the chatbot user interface where the edit cog control was rendered behind the chat window element. The visual layering problem meant site builders could not access the configuration controls for the chatbot block.

The fix was implemented as part of the migration to the latest version of FlowDrop UI in issue [#3572310](https://www.drupal.org/project/flowdrop_ui_agents/issues/3572310). No diff is available for this specific issue because the resolution was rolled into the larger UI update. The corrected CSS or layout adjustments ensure the edit controls now appear above the chat window with the proper stacking order.
