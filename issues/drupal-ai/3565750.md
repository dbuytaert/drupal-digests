# #3565750: Make it easier to drag and drop agents and tools onto nodes

- **Project:** Drupal AI
- **Type:** Major task
- **Version:** 1.0.x-dev
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Discussion:** [#3565750](https://www.drupal.org/node/3565750) · 4 contributors · 10 comments

## Summary

This issue improves the drag-and-drop interface for building AI agent workflows. Previously, connecting agents, tools, assistants, and chatbots required multiple clicks to draw connection lines. Now you can drag components directly onto compatible targets to automatically create connections, making it faster to assemble AI workflows visually.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

This issue addressed usability challenges in the flowdrop_ui_agents module's visual workflow builder. The original interface required users to manually draw connection lines between components (agents, tools, assistants, and chatbots) using multiple clicks.

The fix implements automatic "snap and attach" behavior when dragging components onto compatible targets. The connection rules enforce the module's architecture: tools attach to agents but not assistants, agents attach to assistants or other agents, chatbots attach only to agents, and assistants cannot attach to anything. Tools can also be placed independently on the canvas and later dragged onto compatible targets.

The implementation was completed during a migration to a newer version of the FlowDrop UI library, as referenced in issue [#3572310](https://www.drupal.org/project/flowdrop_ui_agents/issues/3572310). A regression was noted during development but was ultimately resolved with an improved approach to the drag-and-drop interaction.

## Collaboration

d34dman identified that the fix was delivered through the FlowDrop UI migration work. yautja_cetanu tracked the issue through multiple iterations, caught a regression during demos, and filed follow-up issue [#3573955](https://www.drupal.org/project/flowdrop_ui_agents/issues/3573955) to address remaining edge cases with dragging tools onto assistants. gxleano confirmed the implementation approach.
