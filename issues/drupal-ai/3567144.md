# #3567144: Chat configuration select lists use machine names not labels

- **Project:** Drupal AI
- **Type:** Major task
- **Version:** 1.0.x-dev
- **Status:** Fixed

## Summary

This fix corrects configuration forms in the Chatbot feature to display human-readable labels instead of machine names in dropdown lists. Previously, dropdowns for theme selection, region placement, styling options, and toggle states showed internal machine names, making them difficult to read and use. The forms now display proper labels, improving usability for site administrators configuring chatbot appearance and behavior.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

This was a regression in the Chatbot configuration interface where multiple select lists displayed machine names instead of user-friendly labels. The affected fields included theme selection, region placement, style options, placement settings, and toggle state controls in the block placement, styling settings, and advanced settings sections.

The fix was implemented as part of migrating to the latest version of FlowDrop UI in issue [#3572310](https://www.drupal.org/project/flowdrop_ui_agents/issues/3572310). The migration ensured that form element options properly map machine names to their corresponding labels for display purposes.

No diff is available for this issue as the changes were integrated through the FlowDrop UI Agents project update rather than committed directly to this issue.

## Timeline

- Opened: January 12, 2026

## Collaboration

yautja_cetanu identified and reported the regression with multiple affected form fields. d34dman and gxleano coordinated to address the issue as part of the broader FlowDrop UI migration effort, ensuring the fix was integrated systematically rather than patched individually.
