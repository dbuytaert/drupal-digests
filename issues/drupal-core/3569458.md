## Summary

All references to the JSON:API specification website in Drupal core now use secure HTTPS URLs instead of HTTP. This ensures links to the specification documentation are accessed over encrypted connections. The change affects documentation comments, error messages, and test assertions throughout the JSON:API module but does not change any functionality.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

This change updates 44 occurrences of `http://jsonapi.org` URLs to `https://jsonapi.org` across the JSON:API module. The updates span multiple file types including API documentation (`jsonapi.api.php`), class constants in `JsonApiSpec::SUPPORTED_SPECIFICATION_PERMALINK`, PHPDoc `@see` and `@link` tags, inline comments, error response headers in `JsonApiRequestValidator`, and test assertions in `ResourceTestBase` and related test classes.

The changes were applied using a scripted find-and-replace command to ensure consistency. All modified URLs were verified to work correctly with HTTPS. Most changes are in comments and documentation, making this a safe internal improvement. Three functional code changes include the specification permalink constant value, an HTTP response `Link` header value, and test assertion expectations, but these do not alter behavior since the URLs still resolve correctly.

## Collaboration

quietone opened this issue as part of a broader initiative ([#3399840](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3399840)) to migrate all HTTP URLs in core to HTTPS. Sujal Kshatri created the merge request, applied the scripted replacement, and documented the commands used. dcam rebased the branch and performed thorough validation, checking that all URLs work and reviewing the changes for unintended replacements. Stefan lehmann independently verified the changes and confirmed the approach was sound.
