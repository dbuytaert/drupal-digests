## Summary

When committers add or remove subsystem and topic maintainers, they also need to update documentation pages, Slack channels, and email groups. These follow-up steps were sometimes being forgotten. The commit code check script now prints a blue informational message whenever MAINTAINERS.txt changes, reminding committers to make those related updates and linking to instructions.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

The `commit-code-check.sh` script now tracks when `core/MAINTAINERS.txt` is modified in a commit. When a change is detected, it sets the `MAINTAINERS_TXT_CHANGED` flag and prints a blue informational message at the end of the commit checks.

The message reminds committers to update related resources like documentation pages, Slack channels, and email groups. It includes a link to the policy page at drupal.org/about/core/policies/maintainers/add-or-remove-a-subsystem-or-topic-maintainer.

This follows the existing pattern in the script for detecting changes to cspell dictionary files. The check uses a blue color (via `tput setaf 4`) to distinguish informational messages from errors (red) and success messages (green). The implementation adds the check during the file scanning loop and outputs the message after all other checks complete.
