## Summary

Drupal now supports fullscreen editing in CKEditor 5, a feature that was available in CKEditor 4 but missing after the upgrade to CKEditor 5. Content editors can now expand the editor to fill their entire browser window, providing more space to work with complex content and see more of their text at once. This is especially helpful when working in narrow admin themes or when editing long documents. Site administrators can add the fullscreen button to any text format toolbar through the standard CKEditor configuration interface.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

This change registers CKEditor 5's fullscreen plugin, which has been available in CKEditor 5 core since version 45.0.0, as a Drupal plugin. The implementation adds a new `ckeditor5_fullscreen` entry to `ckeditor5.ckeditor5.yml` that wraps the upstream `fullscreen.Fullscreen` plugin. It includes the fullscreen JavaScript library in `core.libraries.yml` pointing to `assets/vendor/ckeditor5/fullscreen/fullscreen.js`, and provides an admin library with CSS to style the toolbar button icon.

The fullscreen plugin requires no configuration beyond adding it to a text format's toolbar. It adds no HTML elements to content, so `elements: false` is set in the plugin definition. An SVG icon (`fullscreen-enter.svg`) is provided for the toolbar button, styled through `fullscreen.admin.css`. The feature was requested shortly after CKEditor 5 became the default editor in Drupal 10, but implementation was postponed waiting for upstream to add the functionality. CKEditor eventually released the feature as part of their core distribution, making integration straightforward.

## Timeline

- Opened: January 4, 2023
- Committed: February 13, 2026 (3 years later)

## Collaboration

This issue remained open for over two years, from January 2023 when CKEditor 5 became the default until upstream finally released the fullscreen feature in late 2024. Multiple contributors noted the accessibility and usability implications for content editors working in constrained spaces. el7cosmos created the merge request that ultimately landed. mark_fullmer updated the issue summary to clarify the user interface changes. rkoller tested accessibility implications and identified upstream issues to be addressed by CKEditor, helping ensure the feature didn't block on concerns that weren't Drupal's to solve. longwave committed the change after confirming those concerns should be handled upstream.

## Lessons learned

- When a widely-requested feature becomes available upstream but is temporarily provided through a contrib module, add it to core once it stabilizes upstream. Users shouldn't need to install additional modules for functionality that's part of the upstream library's core release. *(via bnjmnm, catch, longwave)*
- When identifying UX or accessibility issues in a feature that comes from an upstream library, file those issues upstream rather than patching them in the integration layer. The root cause should be fixed where the feature is implemented. *(via longwave, rkoller)*
