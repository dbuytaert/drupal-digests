## Summary

The Navigation module's mobile sidebar now allows keyboard users to reach the close button by pressing the TAB key. Previously, keyboard users could open the mobile sidebar but had no way to close it without a mouse, violating basic accessibility requirements. This fix ensures that all users can navigate and interact with the mobile sidebar independently.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

The Navigation module's mobile sidebar close button was incorrectly removed from keyboard navigation by setting `tabindex="-1"` in the `navigation.html.twig` template. This violated WCAG 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A) because keyboard users could open the mobile sidebar using the "Expand sidebar" button but had no keyboard method to close it again.

The fix removes the `tabindex="-1"` attribute from the close button's attributes in `navigation.html.twig`. Without an explicit negative tabindex, the button follows normal DOM order and receives focus naturally after the logo link when users tab through the mobile sidebar. A code comment was added to document that the close button should remain in the tab sequence to prevent future regressions.

This change is part of broader accessibility improvements to the Navigation module, specifically following up on the mobile focus trap implementation in [#3443571](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3443571) and addressing issues identified in the accessibility review plan [#3391723](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3391723).

## Collaboration

kentr identified and fixed this accessibility gap as a follow-up to focus trap work. rkoller worked with katannshaw, mgifford, and mherchel to evaluate the issue as a blocker for the Navigation accessibility review. mherchel thoroughly tested the fix across multiple scenarios including desktop widths and closed drawer states. The team discussed nuances like tab order placement and whether to follow DOM order, ultimately choosing the simpler approach that respects natural document flow.
