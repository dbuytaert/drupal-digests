## Summary

Drupal core templates no longer include redundant WAI-ARIA role attributes on HTML5 semantic elements. Modern browsers automatically expose the correct accessibility roles for elements like `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>`, making explicit role attributes unnecessary. This change resolves HTML validation warnings and cleans up markup without affecting accessibility. The explicit role attributes were originally added to support Internet Explorer 11, which Drupal no longer supports.

## Impact

No upgrade or configuration changes required.

## Technical details

This change removes explicit `role` attributes from HTML5 semantic elements in Twig templates throughout Drupal core. Modern browsers map these elements to their implicit ARIA landmark roles: `<main>` maps to `role="main"`, `<nav>` to `role="navigation"`, `<aside>` to `role="complementary"`, `<header>` to `role="banner"`, and `<footer>` to `role="contentinfo"`.

The redundant attributes were originally added for Internet Explorer 11, which failed to pass implicit landmark roles to accessibility APIs. With Drupal 10+ dropping IE11 support, these attributes became unnecessary markup that triggered HTML validation warnings.

Templates affected include `page.html.twig`, `maintenance-page.html.twig`, `install-page.html.twig`, `breadcrumb.html.twig`, `pager.html.twig`, `toolbar.html.twig`, and menu block templates across the Claro, Olivero, Umami, and starterkit themes. JavaScript selectors in `mobile.install.js` were updated from `header[role="banner"]` to `header`. Test assertions checking for role attributes were also updated.

The Stable 9 theme was intentionally excluded from these changes to preserve backward compatibility for sites using CSS or JavaScript selectors that target role attributes.

## Upgrade

If your custom theme overrides any of the affected core templates and includes custom CSS or JavaScript that selects elements by their role attribute (e.g., `header[role="banner"]`), update those selectors to use the element name alone or add a class selector instead:

```javascript
// Before
const header = document.querySelector('header[role="banner"]');

// After
const header = document.querySelector('header');
```

## Timeline

- Opened: January 24, 2016
- Committed: February 13, 2026 (10 years later)

## Collaboration

This issue was opened by BarisW in January 2016 and postponed for nearly a decade until Drupal could drop Internet Explorer 11 support. Andrew Macpherson provided crucial technical research about browser accessibility API behavior and advocated for waiting until IE11 support ended. Mike Gifford championed the accessibility improvements and helped confirm the change was safe for modern assistive technologies. Liam Morland revived the issue after IE11 support was dropped and created the merge request. Mike Herchel expanded the scope to cover all affected templates across Olivero and Claro themes. Benjamin Mullins confirmed that Stable 9 should be excluded to preserve backward compatibility.

## Lessons learned

- When HTML5 semantic elements have implicit ARIA roles, explicitly declaring the same role is redundant once all supported browsers correctly expose those implicit roles to assistive technologies. However, explicit roles may still be necessary to work around accessibility bugs in specific browsers, even if they cause validation warnings. *(via andrewmacpherson)*
- When fixing markup issues in stable themes, weigh the benefits against breaking CSS or JavaScript selectors that rely on the existing attributes. Even technically redundant markup should not be changed in stable themes if it provides no user-facing improvement and could cause regressions. *(via longwave, bnjmnm)*
